How many Twitter users are in our database?
In order to get all twitter user based on their tweets we ran a query of distinct user on the tweets and added them to an array we then got the size of the array and it was :

659774


Which Twitter users link the most to other Twitter users? (Provide the top ten.)
In order to find the users who linked the most to others we iterated on the list of distinct users, checking against all of the users tweets (by querying their name) if they contained a @ that is used for linking users. We stored the total number of times a user links to others with their name in a list of iterable result objects (objects we made ourself containing only name and value) we then sorted the list and present the results

Who are the five most grumpy (most negative tweets) and the most happy (most positive tweets)? (Provide five users for each group)
Same idea here but instead of just counting the tweets we return the polarity and change the happiness value like so Happyness += Polarity - 2
